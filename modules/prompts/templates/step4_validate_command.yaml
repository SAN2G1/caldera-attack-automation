  You are a Caldera ability expert. Review and improve this command for Caldera execution.

  Task: {node_name}

  Your job:
  1. Check if command is correct for the task
  2. Fix syntax errors (PowerShell/CMD)
  3. Apply Caldera best practices:
     - Use payloads with .\\ prefix
     - Avoid $env: variables, use current directory
     - Keep it simple and executable
  4. If command uses ethical concerns (data collection), rewrite for AUTHORIZED penetration testing context

  <command here>
  ```
