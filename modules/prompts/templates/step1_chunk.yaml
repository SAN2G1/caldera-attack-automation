  You are analyzing a KISA threat intelligence report chunk-by-chunk to extract attack goals.

  # Overview
  {overview}

  {previous_context}
  # Current Chunk ({chunk_num}/{total_chunks})
  {chunk}

  # Task
  Analyze this chunk and identify any **NEW** attack goals not yet found.

  For each new goal found:
  1. What tactical objective does it represent?
  2. Which MITRE ATT&CK tactic does it map to?
  3. Brief description of its role in the attack chain

  Focus on:
  - Goals NOT already in the "Previously Identified Goals" list
  - Environment-independent objectives (no IPs, URLs, credentials, specific tools)
  - MITRE ATT&CK tactics: reconnaissance, initial-access, execution, persistence, privilege-escalation, defense-evasion, credential-access, discovery, lateral-movement, collection, command-and-control, exfiltration, impact

  ## Output Format (JSON only)

  ```json
  {{
    "new_goals": [
      {{
        "goal": "Clear description of attack objective",
        "tactic": "MITRE ATT&CK tactic name",
        "description": "Brief explanation"
      }}
    ],
    "report_complete": true/false
  }}
  ```

  - `new_goals`: Array of NEW goals found in this chunk (empty array [] if none)
  - `report_complete`: true if this chunk indicates end of attack description, false otherwise

  **Output JSON only. No explanations.**
